It was mentioned that the Autodesk folks might be making a post-processor for MaslowCNC (GC). In preperation for optimization of Fusion360 for use with MaslowCNC I've created and shared a Fusion360 Project that incorporates and extends the 'All_Parts_Laid_Out.svg' document, designed for cutting MaslowCNC from a single sheet of plywood, and hope to continue to update this Fusion360 Project file to allow easier creation of additional MaslowCNCs and to make it easier for folks to begin building and working with Fusion360 to design things to be built with MaslowCNC.  

Updated (7/7/17):

   Parts Sketch, suitable for cutting all parts from a single piece of Plywood.
   Seperate 'extrusions' for each part
   Simple Component Paths: The Bare minimum to make the shapes and cuts necessary for the MaslowCNC parts. 
   Advanced Component Paths: All part paths, Pockets for the Sled mounting bolts, the Rigid Router's own plastic sled, engraved angle braces. 
   
   
To Be added: 

  More accurate machine settings (Feeds and Speeds) for all paths.
  Roundover cuts for the Advanced sled, using a V-Bit

I've also found what purports to be, a more accurate Fusion360 PostProcessor for GRBL:

Experienced Fusion 360 users/MaslowCNC Developers are welcome to contact me in order to be added as collaborators on this project as admittedly my Fusion 360 experience is low and do not yet have a MaslowCNC built, although that should change within the month.
