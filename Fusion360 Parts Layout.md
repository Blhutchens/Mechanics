# Unofficial Fusion360 parts file
---  
It was mentioned that the Autodesk folks might be making a post-processor for MaslowCNC (GC). In preperation for optimization of Fusion360 for use with MaslowCNC I've created and shared a Fusion360 Project that incorporates and extends the 'All_Parts_Laid_Out.svg' document, designed for cutting MaslowCNC from a single sheet of plywood, and hope to continue to update this Fusion360 Project file to allow easier creation of additional MaslowCNCs and to make it easier for folks to begin building and working with Fusion360 to design things to be built with MaslowCNC.

Experienced Fusion 360 users and/or active MaslowCNC Developers are welcome to contact me in order to be added as collaborators on this project within the Fusion 360 Cloud platform.
